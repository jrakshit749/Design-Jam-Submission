# The one I admire
In reality I admire myself from the future. When you admire others you tend to become like them. But when you admire yourself 10 years from now, you strive to become a better version of yourself. 
Here is my portfolio for all of you to view. 
I wish my best to all the other coders out there. 
Keep rewarding yourself, keep admiring yourself,  keep reminding to admire yourself.
